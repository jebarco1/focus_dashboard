        text:<P>First and foremost, Bootstrap is easy to learn. Due to its popularity, plenty of tutorials and online forums are available to help you get started.<br />One of the reasons why Bootstrap is so popular among web developers and web designers is that it has a simple file structure. Its files are compiled for easy access, and it only requires basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JS to modify them.<br />You can also use themes for popular content management systems as learning tools. For example, most WordPress themes were developed using Bootstrap, which any beginner web developer can access. <br />To increase the site's page load time, Bootstrap minifies the CSS and JavaScript files. Additionally, Bootstrap maintains consistency across the syntax between websites and developers, which is ideal for team-based projects.</P>

This will benefit your websiteâ€™s performance, as reducing image sizes ispart of the site optimization process.<br />Bootstrap also provides additional classes likeimg-circle and .img-rounded, which help to modify the images' shape.</P>
